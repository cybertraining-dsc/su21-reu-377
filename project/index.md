## Abstract

Breast Cancer is one of the most dangerous type of disease that affects many women. For detecting Breast Cancer, machine learning techniques are applied to improve the accuracy of diagnosis. We collected data from African American women that have been diagnosed with Breast Cancer. Through the use of Artificial Intellingence, we will be able to detect the specific forms of Breast Cancer.

## 1. Introduction

  The leading cause of cancer death in women worldwide is breast cancer. This deadly form of cancer has impacted many women across the globe. Specifically, African American women have been the most negatively impacted. Their death rates due to breast cancer have surpassed all other ethnicities. Serial screening is an essential part in detecting Breast cancer. Detecting the early stages of this disease and decreasing mortality rates is most effective by utilizing serial screening. Some women detect that they could have breast cancer by discovering a painless lump in their breast. Other women began to detect that there may be a problem due to annual and bi-annual breast screenings. Screening in younger women is not likely, because breast cancer is most likely to be detected in older women. Women from the age 55 to 69 are likely to be diagnosed with breast cancer. Women who frequently participate in receiving mammograms reduce the chance of breast cancer mortality.

  Artificial Intelligence is the branch of computer science dedicated to the development of computer algorithms to accomplish tasks traditionally associated with human intelligence, such as the ability to learn and solve problems. This branch of computer science coincides with diagnosing breast cancer in individuals because of the use of radiology. Radiological images can be quantitated and can inform and train some algorithms. There are many terms that relate to Artificial Intelligence such as artificial neural networks (ANNs), machine and deep learning (ML, DL). These techniques complete duties in healthcare, including radiology. Machine learning interprets pixel data and patterns from mammograms. Benign or malignant features for inputs are defined by microcalcifications. Deep learning is effective in breast imaging, where it can identify several features such as edges, textures, and lines. More intricate features such as organs, shapes, and lesions can also be detected. Neural networks algorithms are used for image feature extractions that cannot be detected beyond human recognition.

A computer system that can perform complicated data analysis and picture recognition tasks is known as artificial intelligence (AI). Both massive processing power and the application of deep learning techniques made this possible, and are increasingly being used in the medical field. Mammograms are the x-rays used to detect breast cancer in women. Early detection is important to reduce deaths, because that is when the cancer is most treatable. Screenings have presented a 15%-35% false report in screened women. Errors and the ability to view the cancer from the human eye are the reasons for the false reports. Artificial Intelligence offers many advantages when detecting breast cancer. These advantages include less false reports, fewer cases missed because the AI program does not get tired and it reduces the effort of reading thousands of mammograms.


## 2. Methods

The goal was to emphasize the present data in terms of test accuracy and clinical utility results, as well as any gaps in the evidence. Women are screened by getting photos taken of each breast from different views. Two readers are assigned to interpret the photographs in a sequential order. Each reader decides whether the photograph is normal or whether a woman should be recalled for further examination. Arbitration is used when there is a disagreement. If a woman is recalled, she will be offered extra testing to see if she has cancer.

Another goal is to detect cancer at an earlier stage during screening so that therapy can be more successful. Some malignancies found during screening, on the other hand, might never have given the woman symptoms. Overdiagnosis is a term used to describe a situation in which a person has caused harm to another person during their lifetime. As a result, overtreatment (unnecessary treatment) occurs. Since some malignancies are overlooked during screening, the women are misled.


## 3. Results

When going to GitHub Actions you will see a report is autmatically generated with some help on improving your markdown. 
We will not review any document that does not pass this check.

## 4. Conclusion

There are some benefits of AI help with mammogram screenings. One or all human readers could be replaced by AI. AI may be used to pre-screen photos, with only the most aggressive ones being reviewed by humans. AI could be employed as a reader aid, with the human reader relying on the AI system for guidance during the reading process.

However, there is also fear that AI could discover changes that would never hurt women. Because the adoption of AI systems will alter the current screening program, it's crucial to determine how accurate AI is in breast screening clinical practice before making any changes. It's uncertain how effective AI is at detecting breast cancer in different sorts of women or in different groups of women (for example different ethnic groups). AI could significantly minimize staff workload, as well as the proportion of cancers overlooked during screening, and the amount of women who are asked to return for more tests despite the fact that they do not have cancer. Unfortunately, the evidence for cancer is of poor quality.


## 2.3. Report or Project

You have two choices for the final project.

1. Project, That is a final report that includes code.
2. Report, that is a final project without code.

You will be including the type of the project as a prefix to your title, as well as in the Type tag
at the beginning of your project.

## 3. Using Images

![Figure 1](https://github.com/cybertraining-dsc/fa20-523-314/raw/main/project/images/chart.png)

**Figure 1:** Images can be included in the report, but if they are copied you must cite them [^1].

## 4. Using itemized lists only where needed

Remember this is not a powerpoint presentation, but a report so we recommend

1. Use itemized or enumeration lists sparingly
2. When using bulleted lists use * and not

## 5. Datasets

Datasets can be huge and GitHub has limited space. Only very small datasets should be stored in GitHub.
However, if the data is publicly available you program must contain a download function instead that you customize.
Write it using pythons `request`. You will get point deductions if you check-in data sets that are large and do not use
the download function.

## 6. Benchmark

Your project must include a benchmark. The easiest is to use cloudmesh-common [^2]
 
## 6. Conclusion

  The AI system is improving its diagnostic accuracy by significantly decreasing unnecessary biopsies. AI's algorithms for workflow improvement and outcome analyses are advancing. Although artificial intelligence can be beneficial to detecting and diagnosing breast cancer, there are some limitations to its techniques. The possibility of insufficient quality, quantity or appropriateness is possible.

## 8. Acknowledgments

Please add acknowledgments to all that contributed or helped on this project.

## 9. References

Your report must include at least 6 references. Please use customary academic citation and not just URLs. As we will at 
one point automatically change the references from superscript to square brackets it is best to introduce a space before 
the first square bracket.
